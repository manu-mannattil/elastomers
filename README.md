Inspired by recent experiments, we present a phase-field model of
microphase separation in an elastomer swollen with a solvent.  The
imbalance between the molecular scale of demixing and the mesoscopic
scale beyond which elasticity operates produces effective long-range
interactions, forming stable finite-sized domains.  Our predictions
concerning the dependence of the domain size and transition temperature
on the stiffness of the elastomer are in good agreement with the
experiments.  Analytical phase diagrams, aided by numerical findings,
capture the richness of the microphase morphologies, paving the way to
create stable, patterned elastomers for various applications.
